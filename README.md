    <kortham> Depends how the other clients interact when they send their movements to the authoritative server machine. Since the server will have them in slightly different spots than the client thought they were (because of that latency)
    <kortham> The client says shoot here, or drive through the stompy machine. but to the server, you are 150ms late, and the stompy machine is already stomping

    <fax> if its so easy show me how its done :P
    <KatieHuber> you type the name of the film you want, then click search, then it brings up results.  if your film is old, or you have poor taste in films, or you have good taste in films, you may get no results.  in that case, you type the name of a different film
    <fax> >:|
    <fax> I did that yea
    <KatieHuber> if you don't know what film you want, you type a random word like "monkey" or "pirate" in the box and see what it comes up with
    <fax> They don't ahve what I want
    <KatieHuber> in that case, there's a thing called "amazon" or "your local DVD store" that may be able to help :p
